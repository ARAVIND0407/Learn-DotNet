# Escape sequences

#!markdown

## New Line - \n

We can use the escape sequence `\n` to create a new line. This is useful when we want to print a long string on multiple lines.

#!csharp

Console.WriteLine("Line 1 \nLine 2");

## New Line (Windows) - \r\n

We can use the escape sequence `\r\n` to create a new line. This is useful when we want to print a long string on multiple lines. This is the same as `\n` but is used in Windows.

#!csharp

Console.WriteLine("Line 1 \r\nLine 2");

## Carriage Return - \r

A carriage return is a control character or mechanism used to reset a device's position to the beginning of a line of text. It is also known as the enter key and is labeled with a backward arrow symbol (â†µ). It is represented as a \r escape sequence in programming languages such as C, Java, and Perl and regular expressions. It is not the same as a newline or linefeed.

#!csharp

Console.WriteLine("JS is a programming language. \rC#");

#!markdown

# Spacing (Tab) - \t

We can use the escape sequence `\t` to create a tab.

#!csharp

Console.WriteLine("Line 1\tLine 2");
